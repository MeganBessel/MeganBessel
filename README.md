## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on editing and cleaning up a novel I finished in 2024.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Mermaid.js and deep-diving into (Publisher) English grammar
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Scrivener exporting to text files that are processed by bash
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: email or Bluesky DM
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm mostly here because I use a number of open source tools, and I'd rather open or comment on issues on them under my pen name than my real name. However, I like using open source tools, and much prefer them over a lot of other "professional" tools, even if I have to get my hands a little more dirty.
